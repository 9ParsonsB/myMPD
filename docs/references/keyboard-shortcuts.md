myMPD supports simple keyboard shortcuts.

## Table navigation mode

Simply press ``n`` to start table navigation mode. It focuses the first row in the first table in current view. Use arrows keys to navigate in the table. Press ``Enter`` to emit the normal click event, press ``Space`` to open the popup menu. ``n`` and ``p`` let you jump between tables, ``Esc`` exits the table navigation mode.

## Further shortcuts

Further shortcuts are described in the help dialog (simply press ``?``).
